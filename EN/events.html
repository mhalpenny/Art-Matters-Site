          <br> In Hyper Real, and exhibition and event series curated by Art Matters and the VAV Gallery, nine contemporary Black artists take on a range of multifaceted themes. Each grounds their creative expression in a particular subject. Yet they
          bring varying and even contradictory approaches to these subjects.
          <br>
          <br> Analyzing. Remixing. Reframing. Erasing. Reclaiming.
          <br>
          <br> At once meditative and inventive. In each work, by looking at the specific, truths of the human condition are revealed. You can see clearly every pixel, pore, brush stroke and coffee stain.
          <br> What do you find in the reflection?

          Art Matters is a platform for exhibiting students’ work and encouraging exchanges between artists. Art Matters brings art out of the studio and into the city. Artists apply to the festival individually or in small groups (5 artists max).
          <br>
          <br> Artists can submit up to two applications, both of which can be accepted into the festival. Completed artworks can be submitted with supporting documentation. Alternatively, in-progress pieces accompanied by a clear proposal for execution
          are welcome. The application process is anonymous in order to ensure equitable peer-reviewing, as artworks are selected in a juried process by undergraduate curators. Artists receive an honorarium, appear in our catalogue, and are offered documentary
          photography of their artwork.

          <br>
          <br> The festival takes place in March 2019, occupying galleries and spaces across Montreal.
          <br>

          Curators gather artworks to be presented together in a space. When pieces speak to each other, a curatorial vision can be achieved. Art Matters invites students to apply individually or in pairs as curators for its 2018 festival. Curators will be selected
          based off of the strength of their application and the variety they offer the festival. Curators are selected by a jury composed of the festival coordinators, two members of its board of directors, and three members of the artistic community
          at large. Curators are provided a space in Montreal, communication with the space’s staff, technical support, an honorarium of $50.00, and an excellent learning experience. The festival takes place in March 2018.
          <br>
          <br> Eligibility: Applicants must be undergraduate students at Concordia University. Applicants must be registered in at least one Fine Arts course during the 2017-18 year (note: this restriction doesn’t apply to the artist call-out that will
          open up in November) Applicants must be voting members of Art Matters. In other words, they cannot have opted-out of their Art Matters fee-levy.
          <br>
