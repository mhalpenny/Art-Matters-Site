      <h3 class='boxTitleYellow'>ARTIST CALL-OUT</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Deadline:</b> November 6, 2018<br>
        <b>Time:</b> Midnight<br>
        <br>
        <a href='getInvolved' target='_blank' class='nostyle'>APPLY</a><br>

        <br> Art Matters is a platform for exhibiting students’ work and encouraging exchanges between artists. Art Matters brings art out of the studio and into the city. Artists apply to the festival individually or in small groups (5 artists max).
        <br>
        <br> Artists can submit up to two applications, both of which can be accepted into the festival. Completed artworks can be submitted with supporting documentation. Alternatively, in-progress pieces accompanied by a clear proposal for execution are welcome. The application process is anonymous in order to ensure equitable peer-reviewing, as artworks are selected in a juried process by undergraduate curators. Artists receive an honorarium, appear in our catalogue, and are offered documentary photography of their artwork.

        <br>
        <br>
        The festival takes place in March 2019, occupying galleries and spaces across Montreal.

      <p>
        <b>Deadline:</b> October 27th, 2018<br>

        <br>
        <a href='getInvolved' target='_blank' class='nostyle'>APPLY</a><br>
        <br> Curators gather artworks to be presented together in a space. When pieces speak to each other, a curatorial vision can be achieved. Art Matters invites students to apply individually or in pairs as curators for its 2018 festival. Curators
        will be selected based off of the strength of their application and the variety they offer the festival. Curators are selected by a jury composed of the festival coordinators, two members of its board of directors, and three members of the artistic
        community at large. Curators are provided a space in Montreal, communication with the space’s staff, technical support, an honorarium of $50.00, and an excellent learning experience. The festival takes place in March 2018.
        <br>
        <br> Eligibility: Applicants must be undergraduate students at Concordia University. Applicants must be registered in at least one Fine Arts course during the 2017-18 year (note: this restriction doesn’t apply to the artist call-out that will
        open up in November) Applicants must be voting members of Art Matters. In other words, they cannot have opted-out of their Art Matters fee-levy.

        <br> Upon selection of the Board at the GM, the Board meets at least once a month to do the following: · fostering Art Matters’ vision and monitoring its performance; · developing policy; · assisting in the coordination of Art Matters’ events
