  <h3 class='boxTitleRed'>CURATOR CALL-OUT</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Deadline:</b> October 27th, 2018<br>
      <b>Time:</b> Midnight<br>
  <b> Apply:</b> <a href='getInvolved' target='_blank' id='sLink'>here</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Curators gather artworks to be presented together in a space. When pieces speak to each other, a curatorial vision can be achieved. Art Matters invites students to apply individually or in pairs as curators for its 2018 festival. Curators will be selected based off of the strength of their application and the variety they offer the festival. Curators are selected by a jury composed of the festival coordinators, two members of its board of directors, and three members of the artistic community at large. Curators are provided a space in Montreal, communication with the space’s staff, technical support, an honorarium of $50.00, and an excellent learning experience. The festival takes place in March 2018.
<br>
<br>
Eligibility:
Applicants must be undergraduate students at Concordia University.
Applicants must be registered in at least one Fine Arts course during the 2017-18 year (note: this restriction doesn’t apply to the artist call-out that will open up in November)
Applicants must be voting members of Art Matters. In other words, they cannot have opted-out of their Art Matters fee-levy.
