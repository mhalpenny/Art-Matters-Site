  <h3 class='boxTitleRed'>CURATOR CALL-OUT</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Deadline:</b> October 27th, 2018<br>
      <b>Time:</b> Midnight<br>
  <b> Apply:</b> <a href='' target='_blank' id='sLink'>here</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Curators gather artworks to be presented together in a space. When pieces speak to each other, a curatorial vision can be achieved. Art Matters invites students to apply individually or in pairs as curators for its 2018 festival. Curators will be selected based off of the strength of their application and the variety they offer the festival. Curators are selected by a jury composed of the festival coordinators, two members of its board of directors, and three members of the artistic community at large. Curators are provided a space in Montreal, communication with the space’s staff, technical support, an honorarium of $50.00, and an excellent learning experience. The festival takes place in March 2018.
<br>
<br>
Eligibility:
Applicants must be undergraduate students at Concordia University.
Applicants must be registered in at least one Fine Arts course during the 2017-18 year (note: this restriction doesn’t apply to the artist call-out that will open up in November)
Applicants must be voting members of Art Matters. In other words, they cannot have opted-out of their Art Matters fee-levy.
<br>

  <h3 class='boxTitleRed'>GENERAL MEETING</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Date:</b>  September 27, 2018<br>
  <b> Location:</b> VA 217 (Second Floor Lounge of the VA Building)<br>
    <b>Time:</b> 17h - 19h<br>
    <br>
    Join Art Matters at the VA Lounge to learn all about the festival’s 19th edition!
<br>
<br>
    The new team will be introducing new initiatives, discussing the festival’s budget, and offering a glimpse into upcoming events. There will also be FREE MERCH and TASTY SNACKS!
<br>
<br>
    The General Meeting is the time to ask questions, give your opinion and feedback, and join our Board of Directors.
    As a non-profit organization, the festival is overseen by a board of directors that makes sure things are running smoothly. The board works with the coordinating team to shape the festival, provide input, and observe by-laws.
    The Board of Directors consists of five (5) to nine (9) members of the Art Matters Festival. These members are elected for a one (1) year mandate at the Art Matters Festival General Meeting (GM) through a simple nomination process. The members include the positions of Chair and Secretary.
<br>
<br>
    Upon selection of the Board at the GM, the Board meets at least once a month to do the following:
    · fostering Art Matters’ vision and monitoring its performance;
    · developing policy;
    · assisting in the coordination of Art Matters’ events
<br>
