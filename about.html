  <h3 class='boxTitleRed'> WHAT IS ART MATTERS?</h3>
  <p>Art Matters is a non-profit festival that has existed since 2000 in Montreal, Quebec. By now, it's been called the largest student run art festival in North America, and its home is Concordia University. <br>
<br>
Art Matters takes place in March. About ten exhibitions curated by students are spread out over three weeks, punctuated by our signature parties and events. <br>
<br>
Art Matters is a fee-levy organization. That means a fraction of all students' tuition lets the festival takes place. <br>
<br>
Art Matters is created by and for undergraduate Concordia University students. <br>
<br>
Art Matters gets people together. We encourage students from different artistic practices to exchange ideas. <br>
<br>
Art Matters likes new ideas. We promote diverse artistic approaches, processes, and risk-taking. <br>
<br>
Art Matters starts dialogue between students and professionals. We provide galleries and venues across the city as platforms to promote artwork, as well as hosting a Speaker Series and workshops. <br>
<br>
Art Matters stives to be inclusive. Art Matters encourages accessibility and diversity. <br>
<br>
Art Matters makes it known that Art Matters! <br></p>
