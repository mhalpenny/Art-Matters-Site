      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> What happens when the demand is declined? What are methods of concealing, withholding, or renegotiating? What does a methodology of sovereignty look like? Convened under the theme of refusal, this project undertakes
      various vernaculars to jointly participate in an ongoing exercise of declination. To decline conditions, institutions, and infringements, and instead to invite and imagine autonomous futures. To consider gestures, moments, histories, and projects
      of “no.” <br><br>No to being stilled<br> No as vibration<br> No as satire<br> No as dance floors<br> No as conspiracy <br>No as fluorescent<br> No as karaoke<br> No as conviction<br> No as happened<br> No as happening<br>

      <b>Curator:</b> Emily Sirota<br><br>
      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> How do we express the not-quite-speakable? How do we resist the temptation to perform a false coherence? In Magenta Soul Whip, poet Lisa Robertson describes the frustration of trying and failing to explain oneself
      in words: “I want to tell about it, but not necessarily in language.” Borrowing its title from writer Nathalie Stephens, this exhibition demonstrates the ways text can serve both to convey meaning and to trouble it, the way that narrative can try
      to ‘tell about it’ and find itself repeatedly foiled in the attempt. These works examine how visual and affective life can enliven language, make it weird, scramble it into poetry. The artists invite us to better attune to that simmering discontent
      that precedes and accompanies the work of translating new thought into language. Ultimately, they challenge us to consider the ways we might encounter our lives when they exceed forms we can explain to others or even ourselves.
