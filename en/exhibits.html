      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> What happens when the demand is declined? What are methods of concealing, withholding, or renegotiating? What does a methodology of sovereignty look like? Convened under the theme of refusal, this project
      undertakes
      various vernaculars to jointly participate in an ongoing exercise of declination. To decline conditions, institutions, and infringements, and instead to invite and imagine autonomous futures. To consider gestures, moments, histories, and
      projects
      of “no.” <br><br>No to being stilled<br> No as vibration<br> No as satire<br> No as dance floors<br> No as conspiracy <br>No as fluorescent<br> No as karaoke<br> No as conviction<br> No as happened<br> No as happening<br>

      <b>Curator:</b> Emily Sirota<br><br>
      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> How do we express the not-quite-speakable? How do we resist the temptation to perform a false coherence? In Magenta Soul Whip, poet Lisa Robertson describes the frustration of trying and failing to explain
      oneself
      in words: “I want to tell about it, but not necessarily in language.” Borrowing its title from writer Nathalie Stephens, this exhibition demonstrates the ways text can serve both to convey meaning and to trouble it, the way that narrative can
      try
      to ‘tell about it’ and find itself repeatedly foiled in the attempt. These works examine how visual and affective life can enliven language, make it weird, scramble it into poetry. The artists invite us to better attune to that simmering
      discontent
      that precedes and accompanies the work of translating new thought into language. Ultimately, they challenge us to consider the ways we might encounter our lives when they exceed forms we can explain to others or even ourselves.

      <b>Curator:</b> Tina Lê // Éloïse Joubert <br><br>
      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> The body is the site of encounters and relationships, of oppression and intimacy. Touch, then, is a tool, a means to bridge or accentuate the distance in one’s relationship with oneself, with another, or
      with
      one’s environment. The charge of a touch can be felt long after contact was established: its vestiges cut through spatiotemporality and haunt us in its absence. Touch is soft, tender, violent, cold -- it is the foundation of interactions and
      of
      coexistences. sous nos souffles//vulnerability lingers dissects touch as an all-pervading form of communication and its implications that go beyond the physical.

    <p class='exP'>
      <b>Curator:</b> Chloё P. F. Lalonde <br><br>
      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> porpos creates a space in the art world for craft, for art that has a purpose, for arte-utile. It comments on the notion of art for art’s sake, aspiring to assemble many maker disciplines. These works
      transcend the museum space and invite viewers to become more than viewers - these works invite viewers to become participants, makers of their own. Challenging both artists and participants to think about the way we experience and embody art,
      what is lost in the creation process, and suggest ways to save these losses from landfills. porpos questions utility, usefulness and uselessness in art through multisensory work, tied to the land it was created on.

    <div id="box5" class='rBox'></div>
    <p class='exP'>
      <b>Curator:</b> : Félixe Bouvry <br><br>
      <b>Curatorial Statement:</b> <br><br> The digital era modifies our ways to absorb visual informations, and therefore how we register them. Digital Dreams / ‘’I’ll dream about this someday’’ takes a look at those new ways to materialize
      experiences into a digital imagery,. Wwhich is as relevant for the artist’s experience as for the viewer’s.

      The memory of an art piece can become even more important than the piece itself. So how does the artwork survive the degradation of the human memory? How is it transformed by the imperfection of our minds?
      lingers dissects touch as an all-pervading form of communication and its implications that go beyond the physical.
